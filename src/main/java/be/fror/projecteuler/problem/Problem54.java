/**
 * In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in
 * the following way:
 *
 * High Card: Highest value card. One Pair: Two cards of the same value. Two Pairs: Two different
 * pairs. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value. Straight: All cards are consecutive
 * values. Flush: All cards of the same suit. Full House: Three of a kind and a pair. Four of a
 * Kind: Four cards of the same value. Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same
 * suit. Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
 *
 * The cards are valued in the order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
 *
 * If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for
 * example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for
 * example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see
 * example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
 *
 * Consider the following five hands dealt to two players: Hand	Player 1	Player 2	Winner 1	5H 5C 6S
 * 7S KD Pair of Fives 2C 3S 8S 8D TD Pair of Eights Player 2 2	5D 8C 9S JS AC Highest card Ace 2C
 * 5C 7D 8S QH Highest card Queen Player 1 3	2D 9C AS AH AC Three Aces 3D 6D 7D TD QD Flush with
 * Diamonds Player 2 4	4D 6S 9H QH QC Pair of Queens Highest card Nine 3D 6D 7H QD QS Pair of Queens
 * Highest card Seven Player 1 5	2H 2D 4C 4D 4S Full House With Three Fours 3C 3D 3S 9S 9D Full
 * House with Three Threes Player 1
 *
 * The file, poker.txt, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the
 * file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and
 * the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid
 * characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there
 * is a clear winner.
 *
 * How many hands does Player 1 win?
